We design student profiles based on learning behavior, education environment, and parenting habits to determine which subject is the easiest to learn for the student, what should be the focus of instructors in either classroom or one-on-one sessions, and intelligent recommendations for parents to engage and encourage their childâ€™s learning journey.</p>
